  <h1>TYPES of P0-TAY-TOES!<img src="images/sam potatoes.gif" alt=""></h1>
  <p>"Sam: What's to ruin? There was hardly any meat on them. What we need is a few good taters.
    Smeagol: What's "taters", precious? What's "taters", eh?
    Sam: Po-tay-toes! Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish."
